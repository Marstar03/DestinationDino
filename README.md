# DestinationDino
### The website for simple and convenient travel inspiration
 
## Description
The website is built trying to simplify the issue of finding inspiration for your next adventures. With DestinationDino you can easily browse destinations worldwide, filtering on your personal preferences. With a review system in place, users can also leave their thoughts on any destination they have visited, further aiding you in making your choice.
 
To develop the application, the team has taken advantage of technologies such as Spring Boot for a smooth setup, and an easy-to-use restserver. The database is built using SQLite, providing the team with great and accessible storage, and the site with a compact file containing the data. The frontend of the application is built on React with Typescript for better type safety.
